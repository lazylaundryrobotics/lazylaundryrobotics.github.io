Welcome, pals! 

Let’s build some robots.

With robots like the Roomba from iRobot and Mini Spot from Boston Dynamics, it was clear that robots are becoming more robust than just clunky machines that could only do simple tasks. The Roomba showed that autonomous robots could be accepted into someone’s house so that one of their tasks had the potential to be automated for them.  Some of their time was returned to them. The Mini Spot robot showed that not only could  robots drive on the floor with wheels but it could also walk on four legs and be able to open doors. You could kick it over and it would get up all on it’s own. Robots upgraded to a new level that became incredibly exciting because the thought was how far can one take this? How much of the household chores could you automate and allow people to do other things? Things that people really want to do instead of the chores or house maintenance they have  to do on a daily or weekly basis. Ideally you would have a single robot that had the ability to complete all tasks in the house with no human intervention. The human would simply be able to have what items (clean dishes, clean clothes, clean floors, clean wall, fans, fridge stocked with food, cooking)) they needed to live and do as they wish throughout the day. However, a patch work of robots will do for now. Maybe the Roomba can clean the floors but the Lazy Laundry robot could take care of the laundry and whoever else could do the dishes. Think of the time that could be saved in a given week. 

Our visionary imagined a world in which a young family would get the needed assistance in collecting the laundry around the house. Shirts, pants, and towels scattered around the house were finally collected and placed in a washing machine. 

In the pursuit of building an ideal laundry robot, we had previous experience building a robot for a class, but no other applications after that. We had to buy an existing robot.
